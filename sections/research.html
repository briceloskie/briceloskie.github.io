            <p><strong data-i18n="research.abstract">Abstract:</strong> Hierarchical clustering plays a crucial role in real-world knowledge discovery and data mining applications. This powerful technique provides tree-shaped results that are typically considered data summaries. However, achieving well-organized outputs requires a challenging trade-off between computational complexity (both in time and space) and clustering accuracy, especially in big data scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agglomerative algorithm for hierarchical clustering. Our algorithm constructs tree-shaped subclusters using a nearest-neighbor chain search. Next, the proxy (root) for each subcluster is identified using a local density peak detection mechanism, which guides the subsequent aggregation. Additionally, we propose a non-parametric variant to facilitate the easy implementation of the algorithm in real-world applications. Comprehensive experimental studies on fourteen real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses other benchmarks in terms of clustering accuracy, response time, and memory footprint in most cases. Notably, our proposed algorithm can handle up to two million data points on a personal computer, further verifying its cost-effectiveness.</p>

            <p><strong data-i18n="research.abstract">Abstract:</strong> Clustering is fundamentally a subjective task: a single dataset can be validly clustered in various ways, and without further information, clustering systems cannot determine the appropriate clustering to perform. This underscores the importance of integrating constraints into clustering, enabling users to convey their preferences to the system. Active constraint-based clustering approaches prioritize the identification of the most valuable constraints to inquire about, striving to achieve effective clustering with the minimal number of constraints needed. We propose an Active Clustering with Diffusion Model (ACDM). ACDM applies the nearest-neighbor technique to construct a diffusion graph, and utilizes an online framework to refine the clustering result iteratively. In each iteration, (a) nodes with high uncertainty and representativeness are selected in batch mode, (b) then a novel neighborhood-set-based query is used for categorizing the selected nodes, using pairwise constraints, and (c) the categorized nodes are used as source nodes in the diffusion model for cluster refinement. We experimentally demonstrate that ACDM outperforms the state of the art in terms of clustering quality as well as scalability.</p>

            <p><strong data-i18n="research.abstract">Abstract:</strong> In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3) to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability while maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.</p>

            <p><strong data-i18n="research.abstract">Abstract:</strong> Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) is one of the core problems in graph data analysis and mining, aiming to discover patterns with support levels not lower than a specified threshold from large-scale graph data. Traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms rely on support for pruning, and the returned results often contain a large number of "redundant" patterns; Although top-k pattern mining algorithms only return k frequent patterns, they mainly evaluate patterns based on "objective" indicators such as support, making it difficult to fully reflect users' subjective interests and preferences. In response to the above issues, this paper proposes a Pattern Interest Evaluation with Active Learning (PIEAL) method based on active learning. This method uses an active learning strategy to select representative patterns from the frequent patterns mined from the sampling graph, and collects user preferences for these patterns through limited human-computer interactions. It then predicts the interest scores of the patterns and guides the algorithm to discover patterns that interest the user. In the human-computer interaction process, PIEAL adopts a pairwise comparison based strategy to collect user preference feedback on patterns, effectively reducing the difficulty of subjective evaluation by users. The experimental results on real datasets show that PIEAL only requires a small amount of human-computer interaction to discover patterns that users are interested in, and its test set accuracy can reach up to 95 percent.</p>
